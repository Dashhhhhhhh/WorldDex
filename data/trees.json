    "description": "Towering like a living skyscraper, the giant sequoia has thick, cinnamon-red bark that feels spongy to the touch, with massive, upward-sweeping branches that seem to cradle the sky. Its sheer size—often wider than a two-lane road—makes it impossible to miss in the wild.",

    "description": "Towering like nature's skyscrapers, these ancient giants have cinnamon-red, deeply furrowed bark and feathery evergreen crowns that vanish into the coastal fog. Spot them by their sheer size—some wider than a car—and their spongy, fire-resistant bark you could press your hand into.",
